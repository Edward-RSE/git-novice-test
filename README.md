# Climate Analysis Toolkit

This is a set of Python scripts designed to analyse
climate datafiles.

If you're interested in collaboration, email me at
e.parkinson@soton.ac.uk.

To install a copy of the toolkit, open a terminal and run:

```
git clone git@github.com:Edward-RSE/climate-analysis.git
```

**This code is currently in development and not all features will work.**
